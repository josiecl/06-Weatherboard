Weatherboard API assignment

# Why It Was Made
Everyone finds it necessary to check the weather at some point or another. With this site, it's incredibly easy to check the weather whenever necessary, and it allows for people to check their old weather searches. It can be used on mobile or pc, allowing for a great deal of accessibility from anywhere. Weather is often unpredictable, but with use of this site people will be able to check it whenever or wherever, and be able to see the future forecast as well.

# How It Was Made
This site called upon server-side APIs from OpenWeatherMap, along with the use of local storage and several event listeners. It also utilized Bootstrap elements and FontAwesome icons. JQuery was also used in this site's scripting.

# Problems During Development
I ran into several issues with this site during its creation. I had a lot of difficulty understanding the API documentation at first, but thankfully I was able to grasp that fairly quickly. However, a lot of the time I would have the site working but it would stop after some time. For example, the 5-day forecasts stopped showing up for certain cities. It took some troubleshooting and a lot of help, but this was able to be fixed as well. I also found that whenever I tried to add a conditional for empty searches, it would completely break my code, so I was unfortunately unable to implement this. I look to add that in the future, if able. This assignment took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but thankfully it is complete.
